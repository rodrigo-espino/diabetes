# Diabetes Type II Diagnosis using Machine Learning

This project focuses on diagnosing Diabetes Type II by leveraging machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a robust model that accurately identifies individuals at risk of developing diabetes based on relevant medical data.

## Project Overview
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct in-depth exploration of the dataset to understand key patterns, correlations, and insights related to Diabetes Type II.
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning:** Handle missing values, normalize data, and manage any imbalances in the dataset to ensure a clean and high-quality input for the model.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance and enhance the predictive power of the data.
- **Model Selection & Training:** Train multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.) to find the most suitable one for diagnosing Diabetes Type II.
- **Pipeline Creation:** Develop a streamlined pipeline that integrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction to automate the workflow.
- **Evaluation & Optimization:** Assess model performance using key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Optimize the chosen model to enhance predictive accuracy.
- **Deployment:** Optionally, the final model can be integrated into an application or API for real-time diabetes risk prediction.
This project aims to provide a reliable, scalable solution for early detection of Diabetes Type II through machine learning.
